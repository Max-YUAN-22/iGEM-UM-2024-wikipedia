# 🧬 CavengerX: Ultrasound-Activated Calcium Overload Anti-Cancer System

## 📌 Overview

**CavengerX** is a synthetic biology-based cancer therapy project developed by the UM-Macau iGEM team. It aims to overcome the limitations of traditional cancer treatments by engineering a system that induces **calcium ion overload** in cancer cells, triggered by **ultrasound stimulation**, to achieve precise, effective, and safe cancer cell death.

## 🧠 Background and Problem Statement

Cancer is a global health crisis with millions of new cases and deaths each year. Traditional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy suffer from:

- Severe **side effects**
- Rapid **drug resistance**
- Limited affordability and accessibility of **new therapies** (e.g. CAR-T)
- Poor performance on **solid tumors**

Current molecular targeted therapies (e.g., Gefitinib targeting EGFR) often face resistance due to mutations (e.g., T790M). Immunotherapies are expensive and sometimes ineffective for solid cancers.

## 🧬 Project Design

### 💡 Core Concept

Trigger **calcium overload** in cancer cells using synthetic biology tools to induce **apoptosis** via controlled **ultrasound activation**.

### 🔧 Key Components

- **MscS** (Mechanosensitive channel from *E. coli*): ultrasound-activated calcium ion channel.
- **hTRPC1** (Transient Receptor Potential Channel): human calcium channel responsive to membrane stress.
- **hNOS2** (Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase): boosts intracellular calcium release via NO signaling → RyR activation.
- **Lamp2b-fused exosomes**: engineered extracellular vesicles for targeted protein delivery.

### 🧪 Delivery Strategy

1. Express MscS, hTRPC1, and hNOS2 in **HEK293** chassis cells.
2. Package proteins into **exosomes** using **Lamp2b** as loading facilitator.
3. Exosomes deliver proteins specifically to cancer cells.
4. Ultrasound stimulation triggers ion channels → **Ca²⁺ influx**.
5. NO signaling opens RyR on ER → **Ca²⁺ release from intracellular stores**.
6. **Calcium overload** → cancer cell death.

## ✅ Advantages of the CavengerX System

- 🎯 **Highly targeted delivery** via engineered exosomes.
- 📡 **Precision control** through non-invasive ultrasound stimulation.
- 🧩 **Bypasses drug resistance** via biophysical mechanism.
- 🧬 **Biocompatible and immunologically safe** delivery using exosomes.
- 💰 **Cost-effective alternative** to expensive immunotherapies.

## 🧱 Project Implementation

1. **Gene construction**: Plasmids encoding MscS, hTRPC1, hNOS2.
2. **Protein expression**: Use HEK293 cells for synthetic expression.
3. **Exosome production**: Packaged using Lamp2b-mediated vesicle formation.
4. **Functional delivery**: Cancer cells take up engineered exosomes.
5. **Stimulation**: Apply ultrasound to trigger calcium channel opening.
6. **Outcome**: Cancer cells undergo apoptosis due to uncontrolled calcium influx.
